WeatherMuse is an extension of Meta's MusicGen model used for musical interpretation of weather data.

This requires all the same dependencies as AudioCraft (including older versions of Torch, CUDA, etc.).

- Run weathermuse/test_file.py to confirm your environment is setup correctly.

- Run weathermuse/main.py and adjust the constants at the top of the file (associated with csv file names in the hourly_weather_data folder) to generate music from different cities.

All extensions to the original Audiocraft project are found in the "weathermuse" folder. The rest of the original source code is available to allow for local training.

This is a standalone branch from Meta's AudioCraft project, found at:
